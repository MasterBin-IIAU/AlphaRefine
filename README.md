# Alpha-Refine: Boosting Tracking Performance by Precise Bounding Box Estimation
This repo provides the official implementation of AlphaRefine tracker, which wins the VOT2020 Real-Time Challenge. The implementation of our [latest arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06815) will also be released here. 
## News
- AlphaRefine is accepted by the **CVPR2021**
- :trophy: **Alpha-Refine wins VOT2020 Real-Time Challenge with EAOMultistart 0.499!** 
- VOT2020 winner presentation [slide](VOT20-RT-Report.pdf) has been uploaded.**
## Run Alpha-Refine on VOT2020
The code for VOT2020 participation has been uploaded to **AlphaRefine_submit** directory. 
Please following README.md under that directory to run our tracker.

## Introduction
**Alpha-Refine** is an accurate, fast, and general refinement module. When combined with existing base trackers, 
Alpha-Refine can significantly boost their tracking performance, in no need of joint training or fine-tuning.
