## News
- :warning: We provide a concise script [demo.py](demo.py) as an example of applying alpha refine to dimp. 
**We recommend taking this script as the starting point of exploring our project**.
- A TensorRT optimized version of AlphaRefine is available [here](https://github.com/ymzis69/AlphaRefine_TensorRT).
- The code for **CVPR2021** is updated. The old version is still available by
        
        git clone -b vot2020 https://github.com/MasterBin-IIAU/AlphaRefine.git 
        
- AlphaRefine is accepted by the **CVPR2021**
- :trophy: **Alpha-Refine wins VOT2020 Real-Time Challenge with EAOMultistart 0.499!** 
- VOT2020 winner presentation [slide](VOT20-RT-Report.pdf) has been uploaded.


## Setup Alpha-Refine

* **Install AlphaRefine**
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MasterBin-IIAU/AlphaRefine.git
cd AlphaRefine
```
Run the installation script to install all the dependencies. You need to provide the `${conda_install_path}`
(e.g. `~/anaconda3`) and the name `${env_name}` for the created conda environment (e.g. `alpha`).
```
# install dependencies
bash install.sh ${conda_install_path} ${env_name}
conda activate alpha
python setup.py develop
```  

* **Download AlphaRefine Models**

We provide the models of *AlphaRefine* here. The **AUC** and **Latency** are tested with SiamRPN++ as the base tracker
on *LaSOT* dataset, using a RTX 2080Ti GPU.

We recommend download the model into `ltr/checkpoints/ltr/SEx_beta`. 

| Tracker        | Backbone         | Latency     | AUC(%)   |  Model  |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|
| AR34<sub>c+m</sub> | ResNet34     |  5.1ms  |  55.9  |   [model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1drLqNq4r9g4ZqGtOGuuLCmHJDh20Fu1m/view?usp=sharing)|
| AR18<sub>c+m</sub> | ResNet18     |  4.2ms  |  55.0  |   [model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ANf0KCvlFBbGQPpvT-3WNiy414ANkgLZ/view?usp=sharing)|

When combined with more powerful base trackers, *AlphaRefine* leads to very competitive tracking systems (e.g. *ARDiMP*). 
Following are some of the best performed trackers on LaSOT. Results are present in [Performance](#performance)

* **Demo**

We provide a concise [demo.py](demo.py) as an example for applying alpha refine to dimp.
**We recommend you should take this script as the starting point of exploring our project**.

## How to apply Alpha-Refine to Your Own Tracker
We provide a concise [demo.py](demo.py) as an example for applying alpha refine to dimp.


## How to Train Alpha-Refine
Please refer to [doc/TRAIN.md](doc/TRAIN.md) for the guidance of training Alpha-Refine.

After training, you can refer to [doc/Reproduce.md](doc/Reproduce.md) for reproducing our experiment result.

## Performance

When combined with more powerful base trackers, 
*AlphaRefine* leads to very competitive tracking systems (e.g. *ARDiMP*).
